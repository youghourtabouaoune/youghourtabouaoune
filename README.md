# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Bouaoune Youghourta, alias YoGo

I am a passionate developer with a strong focus on AI and data science. In the fast-paced world of technology, I find joy in uncovering insights from data, constantly refining my skills, and approaching each project with a fresh perspective.

My fascination with data lies in the thrill of diving deep into complex datasets, unraveling their mysteries, and using them to solve real-world problems. This passion extends beyond my professional lifeâ€”I'm always seeking new knowledge, whether through travel, reading, or engaging in meaningful conversations with people from diverse backgrounds.

When I'm not immersed in code or data, you'll find me indulging in my hobbies: Gym and basketball and gaming. Whether it's executing a perfect strategy in a game or making that winning shot on the court, I believe in giving my all and savoring every moment.

I just finished my master's degree in AI and Data Science at UQAM. During my studies, I completed an internship as an AI developer at the Ministry of Health of Quebec, where I had the opportunity to contribute to impactful projects. They have since kept me on as a permanent AI consultant, where I now work on large language models (LLMs), develop AI applications, and fine-tune models to meet specific needs. My work is focused on driving innovation and creating solutions that make a real difference.


Looking forward to connecting, collaborating, and sharing our mutual passions!
